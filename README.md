# Humlefnugg Unit Frames

Yay! Working in progress. It's at a usable stage now, but it's missing many features.

Still to-do

* Debuffs. At least research them, no idea if they're even possible.
* Damage shield indicator
* Research "effective max" with the powers
* Add mount to unit (and hide base mount stamina bar)
* Make units frames top-level frames
* Add configuration
